This is a WIP Node.js authetication app that utilizes Google OAuth 2.0 in order to login via a Google Account. 

This app was converted from originally utilizing the Sequelize library in Node.js to connect a PostgreSQL database to POST and GET the login information of the users.
This original method worked well as anyone could sign up with an email and password and then login after loading the page again, but I wanted to learn more about Google Cloud Platform, so I branched and changed main branch to Google OAuth 2.0.
